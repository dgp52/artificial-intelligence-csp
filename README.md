# Artificial Intelligence - Constraint Satisfaction Problem Formulation

Implement a program that uses a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) formulation to find possible degree plans for students in the M.S. in Data Science program at Lewis University. A degree plan is a mapping of academic terms to courses. For example, “Year 1 Fall 2” to “DATA-50100”. This information can be used to help students pick courses and also to determine a course rotation that allows students to complete the degrees in the specified number of terms.
